**Assignment 1**
In Assignment 1, I created a basic Wikipedia clone using only HTML tags without any CSS or JavaScript. The project includes a header, a table of contents, structured sections like Introduction, Planets, Moons, and an Image Gallery, along with proper headings, paragraphs, lists, and hyperlinks to external sources. The page is fully built using core HTML elements and represents a simplified version of a Wikipedia article in a hand-coded style for educational purposes.

**Assignment 2**
In Assignment 2, I developed a creative Login and Signup page using HTML and CSS with a simple yet unique layout. The project includes user input fields for username and password, a login button, and a signup link, all styled with a separate CSS file. The design features a flexbox-based split screen, a custom login box, and interactive button effects to enhance user experience while maintaining a basic to medium complexity suitable for learning web development fundamentals.
